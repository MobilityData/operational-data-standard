# Transit Operational Data Standard

The Transit Operational Data Standard (TODS) is an open standard for describing how to operate scheduled transit operations which can be used to port scheduled operations between software products (e.g. scheduling systems and CAD/AVL systems), agencies, and more. TODS leverages the existing [General Transit Feed Specification](https://gtfs.org) (GTFS) and extends it to include information about personnel and non-revenue service.
