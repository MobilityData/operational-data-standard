# About ODS

The Operational Data Standard is maintained by MobilityData under the authority of the ODS Board.

ODS was [developed](spec-development.md) with the following goals in mind:

1. Create a common standard for transit operational data
2. Improve efficiency in dispatching, planning, scheduling, driver shift management, and other back-end transit operations
3. Reduce the burden of generating data for reporting (FTA and other)

For information about how the Operational Data Standard was originally developed, read about the [Spec Development Process](./spec-development.md).
