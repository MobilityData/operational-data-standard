# ODS Board Composition Policy

In standing up and sustaining the ODS Board, the current ODS Board:

- MUST decide the number of board positions;
- MUST select individuals to fill open board positions for three-year terms;
- SHOULD stagger board terms to avoid more than half the board turning over in any given year;
- SHOULD aim for geographic, demographic, and organizational diversity; and
- SHOULD aim for the majority of board members to come from transit agencies.

Individuals serving on the ODS Board:

- MUST serve as individuals, not organization representatives;
- SHOULD offer their resignation with significant professional changes, like switching industries;
- MAY be removed by a majority vote of the Board for infractions including but not limited to not upholding the ODS Code of - Conduct or their ODS Board responsibilities.
