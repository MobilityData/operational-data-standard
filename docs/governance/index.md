# ODS Governance

This page outlines the policies, procedures, and structures that guide the collaborative and transparent development of the ODS. The ODS is a critical framework enabling effective dispatching and operations management through a standardized data schema. This document is intended for all members of the ODS Community, including the ODS Board of Directors, ODS Managers, ODS Contributors, and ODS Stakeholders. By clearly defining the principles, roles, and policies, we aim to facilitate the efficient, fair, and responsible advancement of the ODS Project.

## Principles

The ODS Governance is designed with the following principles in mind:

**Merit**

- Changes should have a clear purpose.
- Consequences of a change should be evaluated from the perspective of different affected stakeholder groups.
- Changes should be prioritized by the community.

**Openness + Transparency**

- Discussion and decisions about changes should be publicly noticed and accessible.
- Change-making process should be straight-forward and easy to follow.
- Change proposals should have a reliable timeline for being decided on and incorporated.
- Each change (or bundled set of changes) should be identified by assigning a new version number.

**Efficiency**

- Change-making process should be simple for simple changes.
- Complex changes should be made with careful consideration.
- Streamlined, purpose-driven change management should be applied to maximize stakeholder efficiency . 
- Changes should be straightforward to incorporate by existing ODS Stakeholders.
- Significant changes, especially those which are not backwards compatible with existing datasets, should be limited in number and in frequency in order to limit the number of times existing processes and tools need to be re-engineered.
- A significant change merits a new version number.
